This project provides an RSS reader for iOS that interacts with a
[newsboat](https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat) installation on a remote
server. By sharing the information in `~/.newsboat/cache.db` between the iOS
client and newsboat itself, the *read* status for items is kept synchronized.

## Client setup
Install all dependencies
```bash
brew install cocoapods
pod install
```
and open `moat.xcworkspace` with Xcode. Connect your device and install with
<kbd>CMD</kbd> <kbd>R</kbd>.

## Server setup
The server is configured through the `Rocket.toml` file and an application
specific configuration file (example in [conf/server.conf](/conf/server.conf)). All endpoints on
the server require a secret key (passed in the HTTP header `x-creds`) which
needs to be set in the environment on startup
```bash
MOAT_KEY="secret value" cargo run --release
```
Issuing `cargo run --release` will implicitly build the project.

### HTTPS
It is integral for the application to use HTTPS since the contents of
the `x-creds` field need to be kept confidential. To setup HTTPS the server
needs two files to be present at the root of the project:

* `./ssl/server.crt`
* `./ssl/server.key`

The certificate needs to be signed by an entity that the iOS client trusts.
To install your own CA as a trusted root authority on iOS:

1. Serve up the `.crt` from a machine and download it through Safari on the iOS device
2. This should give a prompt to install a profile for your CA
3. To trust the certificate as a root authority go to *Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings*, and toggle *Enable Full Trust for Root Certificates* for the certificate as described [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/371757/290763).

### Newsboat `urls` file
The feeds that are shown in the app are determined by `~/.newsboat/urls` on
the server, an example entry is shown below.
```conf
# <rss url>                      <display url>                   <tag> <name>
https://news.ycombinator.com/rss "https://news.ycombinator.com/" "ðŸ”–"  "~Hacker News"
```
Feed names need to start with either `~` or `!`, *read*/*unread* status flags
are not processed for feeds that use a `!` name (these are considered "muted").
The tag field is unused by moat.

## Usage together with newsboat
Maintaining a synchronized state when using `newsboat` on another machine than
the moat server requires a wrapper function similar to the one below
```bash
newsmoat() {
  MOAT_SERVER="..."

  # Update the local cache with the cache from the moat server in
  # case articles were read through the iOS client
  rsync -q $MOAT_SERVER:~/.newsboat/cache.db ~/.newsboat/cache.db

  newsboat -r

  # Copy the cache and changes to other files back to the server on exit
  rsync -q ~/.newsboat/cache.db   $MOAT_SERVER:~/.newsboat/cache.db
  rsync -q ~/.newsboat/urls       $MOAT_SERVER:~/.newsboat/urls
  rsync -q ~/.newsboat/muted_list $MOAT_SERVER:~/.newsboat/muted_list
}
```
This solution does **not** work if one were to use several 'newsboat clients' in
parallel. Newsboat was not modelled as a [client/server application](https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat/issues/471)
and pursuing a more robust synchronization framework was therefore not deemed preferable.

## Development

### Import new images
Instead of using the drag-and-drop functionality to import images through Xcode
one can use the provided [getAsset.bash](/scripts/getAsset.bash) script which takes an image as input
and produces a `<image name>.imageset` resource under `Assets.xcassets`.

### Linting
* Neovim: refer to [this](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#sourcekit) configuration
* VScode: Use the `sswg.swift-lang` extension

## Additional notes
The project was mainly modelled with YouTube feeds in mind and therefore
supports fetching YouTube thumbnails and YouTube channel icons.

A [template](/conf/moat.service) for a systemd `.service` file is provided which
can be copied to `/etc/systemd/system` to interact with moat as systemd service.

The server process needs to be restarted for changes to the muted feeds to take
effect.
