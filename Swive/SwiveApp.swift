    // @State should (just like in other UI frameworks) be kept as high
    // up as possible and passed downwards. Subviews which need to know the
    // status of a @State variable are passed them as @Bindings
    // When a @State property changes -> affected views are automatically redrawn 
    // When a state variable is written using '$' it will enable a two-way
    // connection where write operations will update the state. 
    
    // @ObjectBinding is used when we need to share complex types
    // (Reference types like classes) between views
    
    // @EnviromentObject is a third property wrapper which enables a property
    // to be accessible from *any SUBview*, this is useful when we have chains
    // of views were we don't want to pass a state a value around just to use
    // it one place 
    //@EnvironmentObject var root: Entry 
    //@EnvironmentObject var serverUrl:  = "http://localhost:8080";

    // TODO List of RssFeeds, each containing a list of RssItems
    // (fetched seperatly but saved -- only fetch from '/items' when
    // the list is empty or has a diverging number of unread articles compared
    // to the 'unread' atttrbute on the RssFeed)

        // being that the implementation (instead of the caller) decides the

        // protocol)
